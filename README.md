# Overview of the report

The Open Data Toronto portal launched its Data Quality Score in late 2019. I use this data, publicly available through the same portal it scores, to analyse the quality of the packages on the portal and to consider the effectiveness of the DQS itself. The report considers the scoring data, broken down into five dimensions, relative to time; shows the uneven time intervals for scoring; compares average quality and number of datasets scored; and compares proportions of quality grades on the portal in January 2021 to six months prior. Overall findings are that data quality is variable, there is slight improvement over time, and the quality score is not an effective way to consider the portal holistically.
