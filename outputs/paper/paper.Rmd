# Introduction




# Data

Our data is of penguins (Figure \@ref(fig:bills)).

```{r bills, fig.cap="Bills of penguins", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

Talk more about it.

Also bills and their average (Figure \@ref(fig:billssssss)). (Notice how you can change the height and width so they don't take the whole page?)

```{r billssssss, fig.cap="More bills of penguins", echo = FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}

# This needs to be about the random data tha tI sasmpled?
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

Talk way more about it. 



# Model

\begin{equation}
Pr(\theta | y) = \frac{Pr(y | \theta) Pr(\theta)}{Pr(y)}  (\#eq:bayes)
\end{equation}

Equation \@ref(eq:bayes) seems useful, eh?

Here's a dumb example of how to use some references: In paper we run our analysis in `R` [@citeR]. We also use the `tidyverse` which was written by @thereferencecanbewhatever If we were interested in baseball data then @citeLahman could be useful. 


# Results

# Discussion

## First discussion point

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Second discussion point

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
